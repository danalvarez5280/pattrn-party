          <h4>Phillip J. Fry I</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>Fry was born August 14, 1974. He was a native to the 20th century who was cryogenically frozen seconds into the year 2000, having fallen in just as 1999 ended. He was revived in 2999 and subsequently became a Delivery boy for the Planet Express Company. Fry is generally very lazy at work, spending most of his time in the office sitting on the couch, watching TV and drinking.</p>
          <p>Fry is immune to all psychic forms of attack, such as from Brain Slugs as well as the Brainspawn. This is because he is his own grandfather, meaning his very existence is a space-time anomaly.</p>

          <h4>Turanga Leela</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>Having grown up in the Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium, Leela long lived the lonely life of an orphan, thinking herself as the only member of an unknown alien race. It is not until her 20s that she discovers she is in fact the daughter of Turanga Morris and Turanga Munda, shamed sewer mutants from Earth's own degraded depths.</p>
          <p>Leela is known for her extreme sensitivity and no-nonsense personality. She is a headstrong woman who focuses on work first and fun later. She is known for loving animals that are endangered, which led her to meeting Nibbler for the first time. </p>

          <h4>Bender Bending Rodr√≠guez</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>Bender was built in the year 2996 in Tijuana, Mexico. As a bending unit, he spent his life before he met Fry bending girders to be used for suicide booths. After learning this, he tried to kill himself, but was unsuccessful. He gave up on that when Fry claimed that he was his only friend in the future. Along with Leela and Fry, he joined Planet Express as a crew member.</p>
          <p>Bender's chest cavity could be considered a magic satchel, as it has been show to be able to hold a whole human, inhuman torch; at least two heads; cigars and even the riches of an entire kingdom.</p>

          <h4>Hubert J. Farnsworth</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>Professor Farnsworth is a senile, deranged, as well as unpredictable old man who is both a maniac and a genius who was born in prison as mentioned in "Overclockwise". He has a gift and passion for the creation of Doomsday Devices and Atomic Supermen and is a danger to himself, his employees, as well as the Universe in general. He has put at least one parallel universe in peril with his inventions.</p>
          <p>He currently spends the majority of his time inventing ridiculous devices and coming up with equally ridiculous and suicidal missions for his crew members. For some unexplained reason, his eyes are never seen.</p>
