          <h4>PHILLIP J. FRY</h4>
          <p>Fry was born August 14, 1974. He was a native to the 20th century who was cryogenically frozen seconds into the year 2000, having fallen in just as 1999 ended. He was revived in 2999 and subsequently became a Delivery boy for the Planet Express Company. Fry is generally very lazy at work, spending most of his time in the office sitting on the couch, watching TV and drinking.</p>
          <p>Fry is immune to all psychic forms of attack, such as from Brain Slugs as well as the Brainspawn. This is because he is his own grandfather, meaning his very existence is a space-time anomaly.</p>
